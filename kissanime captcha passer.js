	//REALLY NEED TO WORK ON PGRM FLOW ITS PRETTY UNREADABLE
//MIGHT WANT TO MAKE AN OBJECT CALLED solve WHICH HAS img AND words FIELDS TO CLEAN UP THE CODE
//HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THOSE AWFUL ADS COULD DO TO THIS
	//MIGHT WANT TO TRY TO REMOVE THE ADS AGIAN
//SHOULD PROBABLY USE THE SAME FUNCTION FOR DISPLAYING RECENT AUTOSOLVES AND DISPLAYING ALL THE SOLVES, JUST PASS THE FUNC A DATABASE AND IT'LL SPIT OUT A DIV
//SOMETIMES IMAGES THAT ARE 1 PIXEL SMALLER OR LARGER THEN USUAL ARE DISPLAYED, IDK WHY AND THERE ONLY SEEMS TO BE 2 SIZES FOR ALL THE IMAGES THAT DO HAVE DOUBLES BUT TO FIX IT YOU'D HAVE TO CHECK COLOR RATIOS ON ALL THE IMAGES AND STUFF AND IT WOULDN'T REALLY BE WORTH IT SO FRIG IT
	//EXAMPLES OF DOUBLES OF IMAGES THAT YOU HAVE ARE girl, blue hair (hatsune miku with the leaks) AND dog, brown fur AND turtle, stand
	//IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH ME CHANGING MY ZOOM IN CHROME WHEN I FIRST NOTICED THIS BUT ALMOST NONE OF THE IMAGES ARE DIFFERENT SIZES THEN BEFORE AND THEY DONT SEEM TO CHANGE SIZE WHEN I ZOOM IN/OUT SO IDK
